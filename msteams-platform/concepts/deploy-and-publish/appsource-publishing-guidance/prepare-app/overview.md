# Prepare for AppSource submission  

Teams app approval is a free service provided by the Microsoft Teams group that verifies that your app works as described, contains all appropriate metadata, and provides content that would be valuable to an end user.

For your Teams app to be approved, your app must meet the following requirements and guidelines:

* **Distribution method:** Make sure your app is meant for a store. There are [other options](../../overview.md) to distribute your app without publishing. <!-- * **App Functionality**: Your app meets [App Functionality guildeline](app-functionality-requirement.md) to deploy your app without submitting to AppSource. -->
* **App detail page:** Your app meets [App Detail Page Checklist](app-detail-page-checklist.md)
* **Tips and frequently failed cases:** Pay extra attention to these [Frequently Failed Cases](frequently-failed-cases.md) to improve your app submission to approval time.
* **Manifest:** Your app manifest pacakge pass the [Manifest Package Checklist](office-store-checklist.md) and [Manifest Checker in App Studio]()
* **Testing:** You have fully [tested and debugged your app](../../../build-and-test/debug.md).
* **Validation policies:** It must pass all current [AppSource validation policies](https://dev.office.com/officestore/docs/validation-policies) for Teams tabs and bots. Please note that these policies are subject to change.
* **Testing notes:** Include proper [Test notes for validation](#Test-notes-for-validation/approval)
* **Privacy policies:** Makes sure your app include proper [privacy policy, terms of use and support URLs](#Privacy-policy-terms-of-use-and-support-urls)

Once you have completed all of the above requirements, you can start to [submit your app to the store](appsource-submission-walkthrough.md)


### Privacy policy, terms of use and support URLs

* The Privacy policy can be specific to your app/add-in or can be an overall privacy policy for all the services from a developer. There should be no broken links and no beta or staging URLs. If you use a generic privacy policy, it must reference "Services/Applications/Platforms" which will also cover your Teams app, and not just your "Website".
* Privacy policy should cover how you handle user data storage, user data retention, deletion and security controls information.
* Your privacy policy must have your contact information.
* Your support URL should not require authentication or login before contacting you for any issues with your app.


### Test notes for validation/approval

You must provide at least two login credentials, one admin and one not, so your app can be validated.

* The accounts you provide should have sufficient data pre-populated for verification purposes.
* For enterprise apps, apps where a subscription is required, or where there is an office 365 tenant/domain dependency for testing you must provide an 3rd account in the same domain that is not already configured to use your app so we can validate the first-run user experience.
* If your app has any Premium/Upgraded features, an account with the necessary access must be provided to test that experience.
* You may choose to upload your test notes to SharePoint. In such cases, please provide a public link to the file.
