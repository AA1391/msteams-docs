Teams app approval is a free service provided by the Microsoft Teams group that verifies that your app works as described, contains all appropriate metadata, and provides content that would be valuable to an end user.

For your Teams app to be approved, your app must meet the following requirements and guidelines:

### Help and configuration pages

It is highly recommended to have help/FAQ link for your Teams app and to provide this link in first-run user experience. For all personal apps we recommend you provide your help page as a personal tab for better user experience.
