# Notification only bots in Microsoft Teams

[!include[v3-to-v4-SDK-pointer](~/includes/v3-to-v4-pointer-bots.md)]

If your bot's sole purpose is to deliver notification to users and is not conversational, you can enable the `isNotificationOnly` field in your app manifest. This produces the following changes:

* Users cannot message your notification only bot.
* Users cannot @mention the bot.

## App manifest

To enable this, set `isNotificationOnly` to `true`.

> [!NOTE]
> Be aware that the value of `isNotificationOnly` is boolean and not a string.

```json
{
  â‹®
  "bots":[
    {
      "botId":"[Microsoft App ID for your bot]",
      "isNotificationOnly": true,
      "scopes": [
        "personal",
        "team"
      ],
    }
  ],
  ...
}
```

## Best practices and limitations

* You cannot create a `personal` scoped notification only bot, as the user cannot message your notification only bot in a personal chat. This means that you can't receive a `conversationUpdate` event that would provide you with the necessary details to send a notification. Your notification only bot will only function correctly if it supports the `team` scope and is added to a team. In the team setting, your bot will have access to the necessary information to either send a notification to a channel or privately to a user.
* Notification only bots use proactive messaging to communicate with the user. See [Proactive messaging for bots](~/resources/bot-v3/bot-conversations/bots-conv-proactive.md) for more details.
